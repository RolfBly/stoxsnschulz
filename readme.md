## stoxsnschulz Readme

Stox S.N. Schulz presents data from the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in a way not found elsewhere. For more information, see stoxapp\templates\about_content.html. 

Stox S.N. Schulz is not a person, as far as I know. It's just a peculiar way of spelling 'stocks essentials'. 

The project is mainly intended to learn-by-doing Python-for-web, in particular screenscraping, Flask, Ninja, HMTL, CSS, and whatever comes up getting it working like I want to. It also presents an overview that I wanted to see regularly, and couldn't find anywhere else. 

The project has two sections: 

1. a screenscraper/data reshuffler (not in this repo, but in UpsNDowns), to run once each working day after about 17:16 CET. 
   
2. a minimal Flask app (this repo) that presents the results on a web site. The site has just two pages: 

    - a page with the shortlists
    - an about page. 

### under construction

run.py and views.py have become redundant.
